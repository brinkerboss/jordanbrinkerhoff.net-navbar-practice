I learned the different parts of the different components and what they did, I built computers and installed various operating systems. My first experience in coding was my first semester of college at BYU-Idaho, when I took C++. It was a difficult class, that lost me around loops and arrays.

                                    Shortly after that semester I decided to change my major with the intent to become a physical therapist. For two semesters I took classes required for that career path, but realized it was not what I wanted to do and not what I was best at. For two more semester after that I sampled classes from other majors, before finally settling on Computer Information Technology.
